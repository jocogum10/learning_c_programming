/*A company wants to transmit data over the telephone, but they are concerned that their
phones may be tapped. All of their data is transmitted as four-digit integers. They have asked you
to write a program that will encrypt their data so that it may be transmitted more securely. Your
program should read a four-digit integer and encrypt as follows: Replace each digit by the remainder
after the sum of that digit plus 7 is divided by 10. Then swap the first digit with the third, and
swap the second digit with the fourth. Then print the encryped integer. Write a separate program that inputs
an encryped four-digit integer and decrypts it to form the original number.*/

#include<stdio.h>

int main(){

//input the four-digit integer


//read four-digit integer


//separate the four-digit integer




return 0;
